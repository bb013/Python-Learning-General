## Hangman
A run of the mill hangman game.

Based on the work of https://github.com/kying18/hangman but with some user input validation that I like better.

### Rules:
The rules of Hangman are pretty simple. In this version the computer selects a word and the user has to guess the right word by suggesting different letters. The user has 3 tries more then the number of letters in the word. Currect guesses are not counted as tries.
